This Raspberry Pi cluster contains 1050 Raspberry Pi 3B+ running [Oracle Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/) and network booting each Pi. Many things have run on the cluster from custom
clustering software written by [Gluon](https://gluonhq.com) with a [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io) app and display, [SETTI@home](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu),
and [GraalVM](https://github.com/oracle/graal) running Java and [GraalPy](https://github.com/oracle/graalpython). Most of the time we disable 26 Pi to get a better number of Pi running on the cluster.

A lot of people helped make this happen. This is nowhere complete since we
had dozens of students from the Silicon Valley 42 school volunteer, Oracle
employees would bring their children as friend's well as friends and family
that just wanted to be involved. So thank you to (in order of involvement):
